Core Concepts:

Kubernetes cluster consist of set of nodes, Master nodes and Worker Nodes
Master node is called controlpane Node. Master node controllers the worker nodes. 
Master node is responsible for manageing kubernetes cluster, storing information about different objects in the cluster, 
planning which container to go where, monitoring nodes and containers on nodes.
Master node does this job using set of components called controllpane components.



ETCD: 
is distributed reliable key value store which is simple, secure and fast.

Kube-API-Server:

	is the primary management component in kubernetes
	when you hit "kubectl get nodes" command it authenticate the request and validates the request.
	Then its retrive data from ETCD and respons back to the request
	Kube-API-Server responsible to orchastrating all operations withing the cluster. 
	it expose the APIs which used by external users for management and operations.
	E.g kubectl command


	- Functions of KubApi server

		- Authenticate : Authenticate the request
		- Validate - Validate the request
		- Retrive Data - Retrive data from ETCD
		- Update data - Update data from ETCD
		- Scheduler - calls Scheduler to schedule pods on nodes
		- Kubelet - calls kubelet and verify response from kebelet wheter pod has been scheduled

Kube Controller Manager: 
	Continuously watch status of the resouces and take remidite action.

	- Node Controller - monitor states of node in every 5 sec.
		it waits for 40 sec before marking it unreachable
		if node is unreachable it gives 5 min to come back up
		if node doesnt come back, it removes the pods on the node and assigns them to healthy nodes
	- Replication Controller
		Ensures desire pods are always available in replicaset
	
	There are many controllers in kubernetes for each object type and those are bundled in to Kube controller Manager
